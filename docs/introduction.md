# Introduction

Life is a flow of time. 

In the Bhagavad Gita the Lord says, *"I am Time."* 

When people waste their time unnecessarily, they forget that they are wasting their life. Time wasted is life wasted. This life is a gift of God, and we should utilize this life intelligently for self-improvement and inner transformation.

## Key Points

1. Through positive thoughts, inspiring talk and words, and productive work, one can use time fruitfully and live a loving lifestyle of beauty and perfection.

2. Many spiritual masters have advised seekers to write a spiritual diary to keep a strict note of their daily activities and practice, and to use it for their self-analysis.

## Things to Remember

1. Consider and complete the questions with a prayerful attitude.
2. You are your best friend. Be sincere while completing it.
3. Retire with prayer and forgiveness.
4. You can assess your actions weekly or monthly.
