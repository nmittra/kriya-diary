# What is Kriya Yoga?

The ancient history of Kriya Yoga is mystifying and mesmerising. Its mysterious origins are an intermingling of mythology, history, and science that date from the dawn of human consciousness. Saints and sages of India have long practiced and spread the science of yoga. 

Kriya Yoga is a very ancient and effective yogic science as well as an age-old tradition that has been practiced by seers, saints, and sages since time immemorial.

In Indian mythology, even Shri Rama and Shri Krishna practiced and taught the Kriya meditation technique. Kriya practices were explained by the rishis in the Upanishads, by Sage Vasishtha in Yoga Vasishtha, and by Maharshi Pata√±jali in his Yoga Sutra.

#### The Bhagavad Gita (4:1) says that God first revealed the Kriya technique to Vivashvan, then Vivashvan passed it to his son Manu, the seventh of the fourteen Manus or progenitors of the human race. Manu then transmitted it to his son Ikshvaku, founder of the first dynasty of kings in ancient India. 

From then on this technique was transmitted from father to son, which metaphorically means from master to disciple, through direct oral transmission. Apparently lost in the increasing spiritual decline of later epochs, these teachings were revived by the timeless Mahavatar Babaji Maharaj in 1861, who named the technique "Kriya Yoga."
