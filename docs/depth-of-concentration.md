# Depth of Concentration

## Daily Assessment

What percentage was the strength of my will and desire to practice today?

What percentage of the day did I spend in God consciousness?

#### Gurudev used to say, 

#### *"Watch your every breath and be thankful to God before, after, and even while performing any activity."*

This is the beauty of Kriya practice; that it allows a seeker to remain in the fontanel all the time and be in touch with the Divine through every activity.

## Breath Awareness

What percentage of my breaths was I aware of today?

We know the breath is life, and that the breath is also the link for attaining a higher level of consciousness. By watching the breath, one can easily watch the play of the mind and the emotions, and then overcome them. 
#### Lahiri Mahasaya said, 

#### *"Watch your breath. I give you complete assurance that through that you can achieve liberation easily."* 

So a seeker should always keep a part of his or her concentration and inner attention on the breath. This should develop to such a level that it becomes a natural state of awareness.

## Divine Connection

How much did I focus on bringing my energy and awareness to the fontanel (abode of God)?

The fontanel, in yogic practices, is considered the door of the Divine. The door is now closed, and it should be opened by sincere effort. 

#### Jesus said, 
#### *"Knock and the door will be opened for you."*
 
By keeping increased awareness in the fontanel, one can easily progress on the spiritual path. In Kriya practice, there is an emphasis on focusing one's attention more in the fontanel.

## Triple Divine Qualities

How much was I aware during the day of the triple divine qualities of inner sound, inner light, and inner vibration?

Kriya Yoga is a beautiful system of meditation that gives importance to the perception of the triple divine qualities: light, sound, and vibration. Through regular practice of the techniques one can have these experiences day and night.

## Practice Assessment

- How many times did I stop and practice meditation today?
- What was the quality of my meditation and practice?
- How many times did I meditate and practice today?
- How many Kriya bows did I do?
- Did I bow in bed first thing upon awakening and the first thing before falling asleep?
- How many cycles and for how long did I practice the other techniques?

People think that meditating once or twice is enough. But Gurudev used to say that to keep the effect of meditation steady in life, it is important to practice several times during the day, even if it is only for five to ten minutes. It keeps the mind more focused.

Quality in meditation is more essential than sitting in meditation for a long time. The quality in meditation is having more inner calmness, less distraction, and more spiritual experiences.

Bowing is a common practice of surrendering to God and the masters. It can be practiced several times in the day. Before going to sleep, or immediately after getting up, is the right time to begin with the practice of Kriya.

## Self-Reflection

What was my spiritual gain today?

Human life is an opportunity to evolve and grow. A spiritual seeker is always conscious of his or her growth. Like a successful business person, one should have a proper self-accounting process. Balance, peace, and love in every step of life show the gain in life. On the other hand, anger, restlessness, anxiety, fear, loss of temper, tension, and so forth are the index of the loss in life.

Did I advance? In what ways?

Keep a vigilant eye on your daily life and day-to-day activities.
