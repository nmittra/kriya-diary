## Benefits of Regular Daily Practice

The accompanying chart in the above link is for one month only. Save your progress every month and keep the files. At the end of every month and at the end of the year, review your progress and take some more positive steps. 

## Analyze: 

"What have I gained today from my practices, immediately afterward and throughout the day? How has my life changed overall?"

Kriya strengthens your energy level, body, and mind. Slower breathing and a quieter mind with fewer and slower thoughts brings more calmness and peace to life.

Better meditation (with more absorption, bliss, happiness, and contentment), peace, joy, love, and less attachment (more freedom) will make your life more beautiful and divine.

#### Love God and be a truly worthy child of God through your sincere effort.
