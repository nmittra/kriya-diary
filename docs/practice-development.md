# Practice Development

The biggest mistake is to give up meditating and to stop practicing. You must try every day, again and again. Every moment, every act, and every thought are to be used for God-realization. One must really make the effort to practice. 

Gurudev often said, "Your life is useless unless you are meditating and practicing. God is practicing. Waste time with none but God, then time will not be wasted." Practice in every moment is your eternal connection to God. Calmness is godliness. Look for extra opportunities throughout the day to practice, because spiritual life is 24/7/365. Gurudev also said, "You just have to practice and your health will be all right. Surely, if you have the desire, you will get realization. With the deepest desire you can achieve it."

## Conscious Breathing

### The Ultimate Key to Successful Kriya Practice

Watch the breath all day. Develop conscious mindful practice, even during sleep. Kriya is a 24-hour practice. In every breath search God. One breath in love and consciousness is one liberation. Breath mastery is self-mastery. Love God in every breath. Slow and feeble breathing in and out of the fontanel can give more calmness and concentration.

Offering every breath to God is the real "thanksgiving." Bring your troubles, anger, pride, sadness, and cruelty and offer it to God by breathing into the fontanel. To watch your breath is to love your breath. The highest satsang is the company of your soul, in loving your every breath.

There are fifty types of breath, of which forty-nine are active and only one type is the calm breath. If you watch your breath and work, you are always realized and divine. Practice constantly - and you will get constant liberation.

## Fontanel Focus

Practice breathing in and out of the fontanel while eating, working, talking, and doing other activities. Practice being in the fontanel (the abode of God) and remain focused there, despite whatever troubles and darkness (either inside or outside) may come - they can't stay.

In each negative state you are to seek God. Burn it in the fire ceremony, the true fire ceremony of the conscious breath. Focusing in the fontanel increases one's energy receptivity. Search for God continuously in the fontanel. Search for God in everything God gives you. Let your mind always be on Truth.

## Work and Seva

The best thing to give the master is your practice; this is guru seva. Bring a prayerful attitude towards your daily activity and perceive work as an opportunity for worship. Kri is "activity" and ya is "divinity." Work and pray without ceasing.

Meditation is not just a formal sitting practice; any service to God throughout the day is meditation. Do some selfless work regularly. Remember to continually watch God as the doer of everything and surrender all results (fruits) to Him.

Sometimes chanting is a good means to bring more calmness when the mind is very agitated and one is not ready to sit for meditation. Do japa mantra to calm the agitated mind. Pray and converse mentally with God and the masters throughout the day.

## Spiritual "Coffee Breaks"

Do a Kriya bow in an office chair, open-eye meditation when the opportunity permits, or Kriya breathing while stuck in traffic. It will bring more calmness and less agitation in daily life. Don't waste time unnecessarily.

## Good Company and Satsang

Besides participating in group meditation, spending time with kriyavans, or going to a retreat, allot extra time to think about the masters or pray to God. This is also a way of practicing conscious breathing. Reading spiritual books is keeping divine company with the scriptures.

Time spent deeply loving God in each breath and in each thought is also good company. Gurudev used to say, "Good company will make you good and bad company will make you bad."

## Attitude and Habit Development

Everything in your life is the result of habits. Each habit is the result of your past lifestyle and activities. It is said that old habits die hard. Changing bad habits requires beginning some new and good habits with enthusiasm and inspiration.
